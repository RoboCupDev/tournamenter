Installation
************

Linux/Mac or other UNIX based OS
================================

`nodejs` installation
---------------------

Since `tournamenter` is a NodeJS based web app you need to have `nodejs`
and `npm` installed on your machine.

For instance on Ubuntu/Debian you can run

    $ sudo apt-get install nodejs

On Mac with `homebrew` you can install it by running 

    $ brew install node
