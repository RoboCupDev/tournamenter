tournamenter
============

*the last tool you need to manage your tournament*

The system called “tournamenter” was made specificly for the RoboCup 2014,
with the intention of working locally, and serving as a helper for storing
and sharing real-time information about scores, rounds, soccer matches and
most of what spectators and teams need to know.

One of the objectives was to allow others (even a small competition), to
easily use it. The second objective was to make it useful for most of the
tournament types, currently in RoboCup (Rescue, Soccer, Dance, @Home…), and
also outside RoboCup (FLL, Sumo…).

For every tournament one system is required. We didn’t want to mix things
up. During RoboCup, about 20 systems like this will be running
simultaneously to provide access to Chairs for each league.
